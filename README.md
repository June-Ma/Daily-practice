# ðŸ§  Practice Repo

This repo is my personal coding playground!  
It will contain **140 small practice programs**, each tackling a different concept â€” from maths tricks and logic puzzles to random generators and little experiments.  
(+ some random stuff that came to my mind, such as rock paper scissor game)

Think of it as a growing library of miniâ€“programs, built step by step while I sharpen my coding skills.  

Nothing too fancy â€” just me practising, learning, and sometimes breaking things along the way ðŸ˜Œ
